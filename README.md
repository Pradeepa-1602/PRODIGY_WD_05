🌦️ Weather Web Application  

A simple weather web app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It fetches weather data from a **Weather API** (like OpenWeatherMap) based on the user's current location or a city entered by the user.  
The app displays the **current weather conditions, temperature, and other details** in a clean layout.
